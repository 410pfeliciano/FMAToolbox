function ProcessBinary(inputName,outputName,nChannels,nOverlap,f,varargin)

%ProcessBinary - Process binary data file.
%
% Process binary data file, e.g. filter LFP file. This function loads the
% binary file segment by segment, calls a user-supplied function to process
% each data segment, and saves the result to a new file.
%
% If the function requires overlapping segments (e.g. to avoid edge effects),
% it will receive data in the form [o1;s;o2], where s is the segment to process,
% and o1 and o2 are portions of the previous and next segments (half the overlap
% size each). The function should return the processed segment, WITHOUT the
% overlapping portions.
%
%  USAGE
%
%    ProcessBinary(inputName,outputName,nChannels,nOverlap,f,p1,p2...)
%
%    inputName      binary input file
%    outputName     binary output file
%    nChannels      number of channels in the input file
%    nOverlap       nOverlap between successive reads (in # samples)
%    f              function handle
%    p1,p2...       optional additional parameters for f
